# SageRx-Drug-Data-Exploration

## Executive Summary

This project aims to use SageRx to explore various aspects of drug information, including the number of different brands for various drug types and the most common dosage forms for different drugs. The goal is to create an introductory summary of pharmaceuticals available to a general audience, particularly those without a background in pharmacy.

## Motivation

The motivation for this project stems from a personal interest in pharmacy and the evolving nature of the industry. With the increasing number of expensive pharmacy schools, the automation of retail pharmacy jobs, and recent walkouts by pharmacists due to poor working conditions, there is a need for a basic introduction to pharmacy. This project aims to serve as an interesting conversation starter for laypeople who know pharmacists and want to learn more about their field.

## Data Question

The main data question for this project is: What kind of drug information has SageRx summarized, and how can it be used to neatly summarize available pharmaceuticals for a layperson?

## Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

The MVP for this project is a simple exploratory analysis of drug information. The app will provide summaries such as the number of different brands for various drug types and the most common dosage forms for different drugs. The final vision for the app will develop as more data is explored and interesting questions arise.


## Data Sources

The primary data source for this project is SageRx, which aggregates medication data from multiple public sources, including DailyMed, FDA, RxNorm, and the Orange Book. SageRx is a project under CodeRx, a collective of pharmacists and healthcare professionals using tech skills to build useful tools.
